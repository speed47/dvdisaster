- chore: move *.c *.h to src/, and build in build/
- chore: build: finally really fix make parallelism
- chore: use gcc -pipe to speed up the build
- chore: rename CLI version to NOGUI in the version tag
- chore: add missing target dependency in Makefile
- chore: update readme
- chore: locales update

*:The original author disabled adaptive reading
  specifically in 0.79.6 (see changelog below), as it
  doesn't handle RS03 correctly yet. In this patchlevel
  we enable it again for media without (detected) ECC data,
  and for media protected with RS01 or RS02. If we detect RS03,
  we tell the user the behaviour is unpredictable/undefined,
  and recommend using linear reading instead.

0.79.6.patchlevel-3 01-09-2020 *UNOFFICIAL*
- fix: windows: flavor in build version was always 'UNKNOWN'
- fix: windows: the config & log files were not written properly

0.79.6.patchlevel-2 30-08-2020 *UNOFFICIAL*
- fix: Adjust BDXL_QL_SIZE and rollback BD_SL_SIZE to upstream version*
- feat: add --no-bdr-defect-management to produce bigger augmented images with RS03
- chore: remove 2 compiler warnings under Linux
- chore: automatically run regtests under Win32, Win64, Linux64 (regular and CLI-only) on pull requests
- chore: add a Linux CLI-only static make target
- chore: fix make parallelism
- chore: use tags to describe the build

*:BD_SL_SIZE was mistakenly modified in 0.79.6-pl1, we restore the
  previous upstream value to avoid having several dvdisaster versions
  in the field with different values set for it.

  If you created an RS03 augmented image with 0.79.6-pl1, you'll still
  be able to conduct a repair of the image, should it be damaged,
  by using any 0.79.6 version (with or without patchlevel), using
  the following additional command-line parameters:
  dvdisaster -f --debug -n 12219392
  On the patchlevel versions, this is equivalent to saying:
  dvdisaster -f --no-bdr-defect-management

  BDXL_QL_SIZE (introduced in pl1) was also adjusted in this version,
  To repair a damaged BD-R quadruple layer image created by pl1:
  dvdisaster -f --debug -n 62500864
  On the patchlevel versions, this is equivalent to saying:
  dvdisaster -f --no-bdr-defect-management

  The values that were present in pl1 were corresponding to a BD-R
  burnt without formatting it for defect management first, which enabled
  more space for parity data. You can still do it if you want, with
  --no-bdr-defect-management (see manpage), but to follow upstream,
  the default number of sectors for all BD-R implies that defect
  management is enabled.

0.79.6.patchlevel-1 20-08-2020 *UNOFFICIAL*
- This is an UNOFFICIAL version, not from the original author,
  based on the latest available pre-release, 0.79.6.
  Changes will be kept minimal (this is not a hard fork),
  to be able to merge in any new upstream version should it arise.
- Most patches from the Debian maintainer have been applied,
  up to Debian version 0.79.6-5. Patches that are purely Debian
  specific have been omitted.
- This release keeps the debian/ folder untouched, with only
  the patches/series file adjusted. Building the package has
  not been tested.
- Added support for BDXL-QL (quadruple layer, 128GB)
- Added support to compile a CLI-only version, without
  the GTK dependency (only glib2), compile with:
  $ CLI_ONLY=1 ./configure && make clean && make -j4
- Added support to compile a Windows version under MingW (tested
  with MSYS2)
- All regression tests are passing on Linux 64, Win 32 and Win 64.
- A few tweaks and fixes around have been done while massively
  amending the source files to make the CLI-only version possible.
  This hopefully removes a few quirks without adding too many.

THE ORIGINAL UPSTREAM CHANGELOG IS KEPT BELOW:

0.79.6 20-11-2017
- The Verify/Test option will now output dvdisaster version
  numbers always in x.yy.zz format, as the old scheme
  using x.yy (devel|pre|rc|pl)-zz is no longer used.
- The "medium info" tool will now correctly show the blank
  capacity (was previously always shown as zero)	
- added support for BDXL-TL (triple layer, 100GB)
- Sector CRC sums and the image MD5 sum are collected during
  reading the medium and can be re-used by the ecc data creation
  process. Speeds up ecc generation and enables RS03 image
  checksums when generating ecc data was preceeded by a read.

0.79.5 16-12-2015
       This is pretty much a relaunch of the project,
       the internet site and the accompanying documentation.
       There are too much changes for a detailed report.

The most prominent feature of this version is that
the multithreaded RS03 codec reached production
quality, and all required features have been implemented.
A few things will be added with the next releases:
- adaptive reading is currently disabled as it does
  not support RS03 yet and would crash or misbehave
  on RS03 error correction data
- a heuristic for an exhaustive re-discovery of RS03
  structures in a badly damaged medium is missing in
  the decoder
But these things should not keep you from using RS03,
as the encoder is complete and future decoder enhancements
do not affect already created RS03 data.

0.79.4 07-10-2012 (not released)
       ## 0.79.4 is a technical release in order to freeze
       ## and archive some parts of the source code.
       ## Do not use for anything prodictive. 
       ## The next useful release will be 0.79.5.
- optical drives would only be detected for /dev/pass[0-9]
  on FreeBSD. Fixed to work with arbitrary /dev/pass
  numbers. Thanks to Bill Eisele for reporting this.
  A similar problem was found and fixed for Linux.
- blocked menu selection when any other action is in progress
  (thanks to D. Herbold for reporting the resulting defects).
- made actions properly shut down (e.g. remove incomplete ecc data)
  when closing the window or pushing the "Quit" button.
- changed sources for clean compile on gcc 4.4.3
- added #include <zlib.h> for libpng 1.5 compatibility
  (thanks to Thomas Klausner for hinting at this!)
- introduced internal Image object for unified access to
  optical media and on disk ISO images; lots of internal
  changes and fixes due to that
- added --ignore-iso-size option
- Jindřich Šesták took over the Czech translation,
  provided up-to-date HTML documents and manual pages,
  made all (!) language versions of the manual validate
  cleanly, and fixed several other issues in the HTML/PHP
  sources.
- fixed bug in pngpack; thanks to Jindřich Šesták for
  noting this!
- added remaining patches from Jindřich for Czech 
  online manual. Big Thanks!
- more comprehensive and unified version information 
  for banner, --version, log window and log file to
  aid in working on bug reports

  papers subdir

0.79.3	21-11-2010

- Michael Klein provided Altivec optimization for
  the RS03 encoder and valuable hints for general
  RS03 encoding speedup
- included Debian patches 04-manpage.patch,
  06-remove-encoding-from-desktop-file.patch,
  07-fix-spelling-errors-in-binaries.patch
- fixed and documented -n command line options for RS02.
  Thanks to Jack Giles for noting this.
- reworked configure for current NetBSD release
- removed inofficial Solaris support

0.79.2  28-02-2010
Semantic Changes
The new missing sector marking method is now the default.
When interchanging images with dvdisaster 0.70 or older,
use --old-ds-marker or the respective setting under
Image/Image format in the preferences setting.

Changes
- RS03 encoding will check for defective sectors now
- fixed crash when aborting RS03 encoding
- made the new missing sector marking method the default
- confirmation dialogues for overwriting images and ecc files
  are now configurable via preferences

0.79.1 07-02-2010
       A word of caution: This version is still evolving and some parts
       are not yet implemented. It may contain severe bugs and fail in 
       non-obvious ways, even in functions which worked in previous versions. 
       Do not process important data with this version and do
       not keep images and error correction data for archival purposes;
       that's what the stable version 0.72 is for.

Semantic Changes
- query-size option replaced with -a/--assume option.
  command line default is now NOT to do exhaustive search
  for RS02 information; add -a RS02 to enable it
  (old behaviour: exhaustive check was on; required
   --query-size=udf to disable it)
- same changes in the preferences dialogues: 
  "Image size" field replaced with 
  "Error correction data recognization" options.

Changes
- added MIN_TRANSFER_LEN and length sanity check as workaround 
  for buggy drive chipsets (thanks to R.G. for reporting this
  and helping with debugging output)
- added -tq command line option as suggested by Mikhail Arefiev
- fixed alignment brokeness between 32bit and 64bit systems
  in ecc header and crc sectors
- added RS03 encoding (GUI)
- added RS03 verifying (CLI and GUI)
- fixed RS02/RS03 crash when encoding invoked without image file
- added commandline RS03 encoding (singlethreaded/multithreaded)
- added RS03 decoding and verifying (CLI and GUI)
- fixed "typical uses" links in welcome screen (Thanks to C. Steigies)
- added warning when same files are selected for .iso
  and error correction data (Thanks to A. Postkutscher
  for suggesting this!)
- removed ASPI driver and ASPI/SPTI splitting logic
- removed 2GB file splitting

- fixed DMA misalignment when reading mode page 1
- changed #includes for glibc for compatibility with 2.32
- dropped Darwin/Mac OS X support
- removed dependency on installed md5sum command

  RS01 files which are larger than 2GB and provided a bugfix.
- Backported improved Windows locale detection from 0.79 branch.
- made package compile under OS X 10.6; updated OS X toolchain
  to Gtk 2.24.

0.72 (pl-2) 31-10-2010
- changed sources for clean compile on gcc 4.4.3
- Using the CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl() will hang parallel
  SCSI adapters. Added tests to determine the SCSI bus type,
  and switch to the SG_IO ioctl() when in doubt.
  Thanks to S. Seidl and R. Manfredi for the respective bug reports.

- added app bundle creation for Mac OS X
- Graphical bug: red/green sector markings were incorrect when doing
  linear reading with high sector skip numbers. Fixed.
  Speed curve will no longer travel below the x axis.
- fixed rare crash while linear reading due to a race condition
  by improper ClearCrcCache() usage.
- fixed bogus dead sector warning in the linear reader 
  after encountering unreadable sectors
- made adaptive reading pursue raw reading more aggressively;
  effectively trading in place re-reads for seeks over
  the medium.
- --help output for --defective-dump was complete nonsense. Fixed.
- detection of read errors at the end of track at once disks
  would sometimes cut off too many sectors when doing multiple
  reading passes and a carefully crafted number of extra read
  errors occurred. Fixed.
- fixed crash in command line mode when doing multiple 
  reading passes.

------ 0.72 released ------

0.71 (devel-28) 08-03-2009
- changed SSE2 handling; now only the interesting part of
  dvdisaster are compiled with -msse2 and selection between
  normal and SSE2 code versions are done at run time.
  (Don't waste your time searching for SSE2 code in 0.7x -
   there is none; but we need the option to configure for it
   in preparation of 0.80)
   Thanks to Karsten H., Nathan S. and Tobias G. for bringing 
   this issue to my attention!
- changed treatment of CRC failures: old behaviour was to 
  store a defective sector marker; now the actual sector
  contents are written to the image file.
- starting a scan/after automatically loading a medium
  would not always work. Fixed.
- command line mode will no longer scan for available 
  devices when one is already given via -d.
  Thanks to Raphael M. for noting this.

  under Windows.

0.71 (devel-27) 18-01-2009
- Verifying RS02 images would sometimes show slightly incorrect
  numbers of recoverable sectors in the "Prognosis: " line. Fixed.

  on empty drive. Will now report missing media correctly.
- fixed infinite loop on disk full state
- fixed failure on writing ecc files with now possible larger
  cache settings in command line mode

- Phew. English and German documentation finished.
- fixed crash when using ancient CD-ROM drives.
  Thanks to mschaeff to bringing this to my attention!

  less dreaded "couldn't query [several possiblilities] length" 
  errors now ;-)
- added on-the-fly checkum verification for RS02

------ 0.65 released ------

0.65: 14-01-2006
- Czech translation by Lubos Stanek
- made invocation of external HTML viewer more flexible and robust
- started support for big endian archs (NOT completed yet!)
- modularized scsi and codec interface for easier future expansion
- made --random-errors use the internal random number generator
  and allow for independent selection of number of roots/erasures
- Error correction files can be larger than 2GB on FAT file systems
- changed medium fingerprint sector from 257 to 16 (ISO file system root block)
- Windows binaries are now shipped with Gtk+2.6 libraries
- CRC information is calculated and cached when reading the image
  so that we do not need to re-read the image in a subsequent create operation.
- tinkered with speed curve algorithm to get smoother lines
- made sector color markers during linear read more understandable (hopefully)
- configure will now correctly honor $LDFLAGS from the user environment
- added Gtk+ library localization files to Windows distribution
  (thanks to J. Meyer for reporting this problem!)
- fixed bug in the Errors/Ecc block graph which would make it scale incorrectly
  if uncorrectable errors are encountered (this was just a rendering problem
  with no influence on the actual error correction)
- added gdk pixbuf check to configure (thanks to W. Wershofen for noting this!)
- better error diagnosis for invalid ecc files (thanks to Lubos for noting this!)
- modified code to compile cleanly under gcc 4.02

0.64.2: 01-11-2005
- fixed crash when using -u in command line mode
- changed packaging system to allow different package and version numbering systems
  Current naming scheme is:
  . package name = package directory    = 0.xx[.y]
  . version name (as advertised in GUI) = 0.xx[ (pl y)]
- fixed img file permissions for Linux version
- drive selection wasn't remembered between sessions under
  Gtk+-2.4 and higher: fixed
- Manual/Homepage fixed for some MSIE glitches

0.64.1: 23-10-2005
- fixed bug which activated automatic ecc file generation in scan mode
- fixed crash at startup when linked against Gtk+ 2.6
  (Thanks to Radu M. and Richard B. for noting this!)

0.64: 18-10-2005
- reworked console and logging output:
  Got rid of \b usage in locale files, 
  making gawk filtering of diagnostic warning obsolete.
  More removal of read and CRC error reporting in GUI mode as buffering 
  them may result in going out of memory in worst case situations.
  Use the program in command line mode and apply file 
  redirection if you still wish to see these messages.
- fixed a glitch in the linear read/scanning GUI 
  which prevented small unreadable areas to stay 
  marked red in the spiral 
- fixed bug which did not install the CREDITS.* files
- fixed configure to use the --prefix settings properly 
  (thanks to Daniel Baumann for pointing this out)
- added de/en/it man pages supplied by Daniel Baumann
- fixed non-working --spinup-delay command line arg
- added configurable --docsubdir at request of Daniel
- Changed linear reading strategy
  . Sector skipping after a read error is now done in all passes, 
    not just the first one (the previous behaviour turned out as 
    an arbitrary design decision which did not really make sense)
  . Re-reading passes are carried out in 16 sector chunks, too
- provided workaround for detecting CD media on Teac slimline
  drives (and possibly others) caused by silly firmware answers
- provided workaround for read errors which are reported
  as something else by sloppy firmware
- added debugging functions --random-image and --random-seed for creating
  images with "random" numbers. Images created with --random-seed n are
  bitwise mirrors of those created with --random-seed -n.
- hunted down some memory leaks
- turned warning dialogs into modal dialogs
- fixed some minor redraw flaws in adaptive read mode
- fixed automatic file removal bug when in FAT32 mode 
  (thanks to Peter H., Walter G and Stephan J. for noting this)
- fixed error handling in GUI mode: in some rare error situations,
  it would not bring up the intended error dialog, but either
  continue quietly or terminate the whole program.
- fixed empty drive pop down menu after changing drives in the system
  or sharing a dvdisaster installation between different Windows installations
- started support for parsing ISO file system structures
- added some recent drives to the drive data base
- rewrote the drive spinup code
- added function for automatically creating the .ecc file after
  successfully reading an image
- documentation partially rewritten
- added some code to make sure that the "read adaptive" spiral fits into the window
- removed flicker in the "read adaptive" mode text output 

0.63: 01-08-2005
- added adaptive read strategy (thanks to Harald Bögeholz
  for the suggestion; see also the CREDITS file)
- added --fill-unreadble option for better compatibility with
  other tools (e.g. h2cdimage from c't magazine)
- cut down information written to the log window in GUI mode 
  as that could use up significant amounts of memory in worst 
  case scenarios. Use command line mode if you are still interested
  in these messages.
- fixed code for clean compile with gcc 4.0.1
- added auto-suffix option for automatically adding .img/.ecc to files
  given without an extension (thanks to Marcus for the suggestion!)
- changed function test prototype in bash based configure from
  char* to char to work around misdetection of gcc's builtin gettext()
  (thanks to Heinz R. for pointing this out)
- fixed crash in About requester when LANG environment was not set
  (thanks to Andreas for the patch!) 

0.62: 03-07-2005
- added correct return codes to indicate whether reading
  succeeded or found bad sectors in command line mode
- added experimental support for splitting image files into 2GB chunks
  (mainly for use with VFAT an Win9x; avoid this mode if you can)
- added compare function to graphical user interface
- fixed 'make install' (thanks to Andreas for noting the problems)
- fixed german umlaut glitch in the foot line (thanks to GoldenFingaz
  for pointing this out)
- relaxed handling of image size mismatches

0.61: 24-04-2005
- added preferences dialog
- decoupled command line settings from GUI settings so that
  command line arguments will not be remembered across sessions
  and GUI settings will not be used in command line mode.
- more image size detection fine tuning (this becomes a running gag, huh?)
- added --speed-warning option (thanks to Richard B. for the suggestion!)
- added --spinup-delay option
- removed startup-related downspike in the speed graph

0.60: 09-04-2005
- first release with graphical user interface
- tinkered again with image size detection
- added debugging function for zeroing out the "unreadable sector"
  markers (thanks to Marcus J. for the suggestion!)
- made configure more compatible with autoconf behaviour 
  (thanks to Andreas for pointing out the differences!)

0.55: 20-02-2005
- added Italian translation from Andrea Polverini (polve@polve.com)
- improved media type detection
- upward compatibility with the improved media footprint calculation
  from upcoming version 0.60

0.54: 01-01-2005
- Switched from Cygwin/cygwin1.dll to Mingw/msvcrt.dll,
  with some additional functionality taken over by glib2.
  This may cause some short-time inconvenience (please report
  all different behaviour relative to 0.53.1!),
  but will pay off in later versions. 
- Some code reorganization.
- Shortened the version number scheme to major.minor
- Removed visualization via gnuplot. Visualization will be
  re-introduced in version 0.60; please use version 0.53.1
  for visualization if needed.
- Reworked compilation instructions in documentation.

0.53.1: 27-12-2004

  is attempted (avoids confusing error messages when running into
  the encrypted area).

0.53.0: 23-12-2004
- introduction of GNU gettext
- German localization
- Makefile will automatically collect .c files
- Preparation for multiple codecs
- fixed incorrect media size calculation for +RW images
- fixed installation procedure (thanks to Kay D. !)

0.52.1: 04-12-2004
- Fixed the handling of truncated image files (thanks to Harald B.!)
- Better diagnosis of images which are longer than supposed
  (should never happen, but one never knows)

0.52.0: 28-11-2004
- codec speedups and user selectable redundancy settings

0.51.1: 13-11-2004
- fixed bug which prevented dvdisaster from working
  under Windows XP without Cygwin being installed
  (thanks to Andrea and Harald B. for reporting this!)
- removed unnecessary open with write permission 
  within --test action
- Besides bringing scanning speed to a screeching halt on
  slow systems, calculation of the image md5sum during
  the --scan option wasn't very useful -- removed it.
- repaired a glitch which would derail the codec when
  fixing a truncated image
- added --dao option
- added a test predicting a TAO medium when fixing a
  damaged image

0.51.0: 06-11-2004
- added experimental ASPI support for Cygwin version
- added alternative "-end" syntax for specifying the sector range
- added -j/--jump option
- fixed minor bug which made -t option fail reading the CRC data
  on very small media images

0.50.0: 01-10-2004
- Experimental Cygwin support.
- Rewrote SCSI layer for portability.
- Introduced ./configure mechanism.
- Dropped --direct option for portability reasons.
- Changed behaviour of continuing the reading of incomplete images;
  if the image size is smaller than the medium size, reading will
  now continue at the last read sector. Previous versions would have
  tried all unread sectors before.
- Fixed a bug which would not fill in the missing sector markers
  on a sequence of non overlapping read intervals (such as doing
  -r0-100000; -r110000-media_end; the range 100001-109999 would
  have been simply zeroed out in previous versions).

0.42.2: 23-09-2004
- changed the --fix semantics so that sectors with wrong CRC sums 
  will automatically be fixed (previous versions would just report
  them as bad when using the -t option)
- made --fix more verbose about CRC errors

0.42.1: 11-09-2004
- unrolled the inner codec loop; optimized some C expressions within
- code cleanup in the encoder

- changed the caching and code generation strategy in the RS encoder
- added program version information in the ecc file header

- some speed optimizations in the encoder
- the --direct option now actually works 
- removed the #ifdef DEBUG clutter in ecc-rs01.c
- added the --byteset debugging function

NOTE: Debugging functions are intentionally undocumented and unsupported.

0.41.1: 31-08-2004
- added CRC32 checksum for each image block in the .ecc file

0.41.0: 28-08-2004 (no public release)
- Replaced the matrix-based codec with one using polynomials.

0.40.8: 24-08-2004 (no public release)
- removed unused div_tab[] from ecc-rs01.c (which was incorrectly initialized anyways)
- fixed md5sum miscompare in print.c
- added the --random-errors debugging function
