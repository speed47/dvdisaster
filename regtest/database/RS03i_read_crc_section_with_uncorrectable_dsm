* Unrecoverable sector found!

* Sector 21077 is marked unreadable on the medium.
* 
* The medium was probably mastered from defective content.
* For example it might contain one or more files which came
* from a damaged medium which was NOT fully recovered.
* This means that some files may have been silently corrupted.
* Since the medium was already created defective it can not be
* repaired by dvdisaster. Also it will not be possible to create
* error correction data for it. Sorry for the bad news.
* ... more unrecoverable sectors found ...
* further messages are suppressed unless the -v option is given.

All sectors are readable, but 3 contain defective content.
