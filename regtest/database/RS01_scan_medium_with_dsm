Medium "Random Image": CD-R mode 1, 21000 sectors, created 16-07-2006.

Scanning medium for read errors.
* Unrecoverable sector found!
* 
* Sector 4999 is marked unreadable on the medium.
* 
* The medium was probably mastered from defective content.
* For example it might contain one or more files which came
* from a damaged medium which was NOT fully recovered.
* This means that some files may have been silently corrupted.
* Since the medium was already created defective it can not be
* repaired by dvdisaster. Also it will not be possible to create
* error correction data for it. Sorry for the bad news.
* ... more unrecoverable sectors found ...
* further messages are suppressed unless the -v option is given.

All sectors are readable, but 2 contain defective content.
