Tentative to do/ release schedule

Versions 0.79.x: development releases
* restart project, catch up wich recent compiler and OS version
* last releases with gtk-2 

work in progress (this release):

- split GUI code from core source to allow for command-line only build (done)
- merge patches from St√©phane Lesimple (done) and Debian (done)

upcoming (next stable release):

- restore adaptive reading for all codecs

(no more releases for 0.79.x planned;
 except for maintenance issues should the need arise)

Versions 0.80.x: development releases
* gtk-4 migration
* lots of micro releases to revive the project and resolve outstanding issues
  
- upgrade from gtk-2 to gtk-4
- remove obsolete features, especially from the GUI
- ... many more will likely be added ...

Version 0.82: milestone/stable release
 - RS03 encoding considered feature complete

Version 0.83: development releases
 - multithreaded decoding (error correction/repair) 
   for RS01/RS02/RS03

Version 0.84: milestone/stable release
 - RS03 decoding considered feature complete

Version 0.90:
 - Grand finale: add a last new feature which isn't jaw dropping 
   but very convenient to have (sorry - has nothing to do 
   with ripping). Since I'm not sure whether there
   is prior art to this feature, I won't get into
   details about it until the first release to fence
   off IP trolls.

Version 1.00: maintenance releases
   The project is considered finished. By the time we reach
   1.00, optical media should be as extinct as floppy discs
   are now. That won't obsolete dvdisaster (quite to the
   contrary!), but we're probably feature complete in this
   revision and won't need to introduce new features. 
   From time to time maintenance releases will be made
   to adapt for new operating system and toolkit versions.

Unspecified schedule / later releases

 - add pause/resume button
 - optionally pause after n read errors for drives which
   need to cool down 
 - add function for stripping RS02 data from image [done in pl7]
 - add quiet option for command line mode
 - display estimated finishing time for encoding/decoding
 - catch up with many other queued up suggestions
 - provide a function for searching directories for suitable .ecc files 
   for the current image
 - add real UDF parsing to udf.c 
   (currently only the backward compatibility ISO structures are used)
