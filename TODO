Tentative to do/ release schedule

Version 0.79: new RS03 codec 
 - lots of speed optimizations in error correction data encoding
 - multithreaded / multicore processor support for encoding
   (decoding still single threaded)
 - add missing functionality, e.g. adaptive reading
 0.79.5: project re-launch
 0.79.6: re-introduce CRC and MD5 caching between reading
         and ecc creation; cosmetical changes; support
	 for 100G BD
 0.79.7: re-introduce adaptive reading

Version 0.80: milestone release
 - RS03 encoding considered feature complete

Version 0.81:
 - multithreaded decoding (error correction/repair) 
   for RS01/RS02/RS03
 - RS01 encoding (not decoding of course) will be
   removed as RS03 fully replaces it

Version 0.82: milestone release
 - RS03 decoding considered feature complete

Version 0.84:
 - compile option to create a CLI-only binary
   (without GTK+ linkage)

Version 0.86:
 - maybe upgrade from GTK+ 2 to version 3
   (not decided yet)
   
Version 0.90:
 - Grand finale: add a new feature which isn't jaw dropping 
   but very convenient to have (sorry - has nothing to do 
   with ripping). Since I'm not sure whether there
   is prior art to this feature, I won't get into
   details about it until the first release to fence
   off IP trolls.

Version 1.00: maintenance releases
   The project is considered finished. By the time we reach
   1.00, optical media should be as extinct as floppy discs
   are now. That won't obsolete dvdisaster (quite to the
   contrary!), but we're probably feature complete in this
   revision and won't need to introduce new features. 
   From time to time maintenance releases will be made
   to adapt for new operating system and toolkit versions.

Unspecified schedule / later releases

 - native Windows fork
 - add pause/resume button
 - optionally pause after n read errors for drives which
   need to cool down 
 - add function for stripping RS02 data from image
 - add quiet option for command line mode
 - display estimated finishing time for encoding/decoding
 - catch up with many other queued up suggestions
 - provide a function for searching directories for suitable .ecc files 
   for the current image
 - add real UDF parsing to udf.c 
   (currently only the backward compatibility ISO structures are used)
