dvdisaster (0.79.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Carlos Maddela ]
  * Team upload.
  * New upstream version [0.79.5]
  * Refresh and drop patches. The following patches have been dropped:
    + 01-libpng15.patch
    + 06-remove-encoding-from-desktop-file.patch
    + 07-fix-spelling-errors-in-binaries.patch
    + 09-fix-format-security-warnings.patch
    + 21-fix-privacy-breach-in-doco.patch
  * Update license to GPL-3.
  * Update clean rule as old files no longer apply.
  * Update documentation build and install rules.
  * debian/rules: Update mutable file list.
  * Fix generated man pages. The generated man pages incorrectly direct
    users to the directory of the old HTML documentation, which is no
    longer available.
  * Fix display of manual.pdf. The PDF file is automatically compressed
    by Debhelper, so we need to account for this.
  * Resurrect old code to support opening URLs in a browser.
  * Ship upstream-generated manual.pdf for the time being, as we can't
    generate it ourselves reproducibly.
