dvdisaster is available for \tlnk{download-requirements}{recent versions} of the FreeBSD,
GNU/Linux and NetBSD operating systems. It is provided

the \href{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt}{GNU General Public License v3}.

\bigskip

The dvdisaster developer site (\homepage) contains
source code releases for the FreeBSD, GNU/Linux and NetBSD
operating systems. These are mostly aimed at maintainers of binary packages for
the beforementioned platforms. As an end user you might find it more convenient
to install dvdisaster from the package system of your operating system bundle or
distribution. But if you prefer to download and compile the source package on your
own, you're welcome to visit the site.

\bigskip

The source code archives contain a file {\tt INSTALL} with further instructions
for building dvdisaster. The build process follows the 
common {\tt ./configure; make; make install} scheme. The installation step
is optional; you can use dvdisaster directly from the build tree.

\subsection{System requirements}
